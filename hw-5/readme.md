### Emmanuel Stewart

## Hw-5

For this week I went through all the lessons and then went step by step through the assignment. This assignment was hard for me. It was hard for me to get inspired but once I did, I got excited for my idea, but it was a little difficult to carry out.
First I place each star of orion, then the moon. I really wanted a random assortmant of stars so I did a little research and learned how to do it from somonelse and then I tweaked what they had done so that it could fit what I needed. The parts I am not happy about in this assignment is that the tiny stars go too fast and I wish the comet had a slightly smaller orbit, but I couldnt quite figure out how to do those two things.

I found this weeks lessons difficult and I need to spend a little more time with it before next week starts.

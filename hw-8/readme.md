# Homework Assignment 5

This session was a little bit easier to understand. I find though that there was two things I wanted to do with my assignment that I cant figure out how to do. I want my entire film strip to move from left to right, and I also want the "fill" of the film strip to be be the users webcam. I attempted both and spent a large amount of time trying to do both but I couldnt get it to work. But other than that I feel that I grasped this concept and I had fun doing it.

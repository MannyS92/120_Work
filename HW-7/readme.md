## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

### Pre-Function Setup:
An Object called "ball" is created, and its parameters are setup. Including the size of the ball, its trajectory and the location of where it will start out

### Setup
The canvases size and color is determined.

### Draw function
The exact trajectory is determined in and the conditional statements are made. The conditional statements will keep the ball in the window and make sure it comes back.

The object and its color then designated in lines 32 -33.

### function mousePressed

This function starts the change changes the trajectory and the framerate depending on where your mouse is in the frame when its clicked.

Please describe what the original code is doing.

Why is it working the way it is?
What does each line do?
How can you make the ball change direction?

## How did you alter the sketch?

I changed the sketch by adding color to the ball and mouse counter, that makes the program upset if the more you click the mouse. Narrative is my favorite  way to be creative, and through the coding this week and the introduction variables it gave me an oppurtunity to tell a tiny story.

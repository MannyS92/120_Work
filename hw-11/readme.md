# HW-11

This week added a whole new level to p5.js. It also happens to make my brain really hurt comprehending how things are working. For this project I took Shiffmans bubble idea and ran with it to make it my own. For the life of me I couldnt figure out how to code it to add another row of candies. Every time I would write candy, or things like that it would break the code. I left my attempts in the code blocked out if you could help me. I feel like its really obvious but for some reason its escaping me how to do it.

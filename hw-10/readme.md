# Homework 10 Readme

This Homework assignment was pretty fun this week. I had to go over the definitions of functions multiple times before I really got it. I then got to work trying create a hypnotic wheel using functions and arrays. Once I got my hypnotic wheel spinning though I really wanted to add something more to it , so I gave it the ability to rotate the entire big wheel around a center point. From there I really just wanted to explore how these hypnotic circles can interact with each other.

I understand whats going on but I find I still need to go back multiple times to remember how to do something. Im looking forward to next week.

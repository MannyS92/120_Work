# Homework 10 Readme

This Homework assignment was pretty fun this week. I had to go over the definitions of functions multiple times before I really got it. I then got to work trying create a hypnotic wheel using functions and arrays. Once I got my hypnotic wheel spinning though I really wanted to add something more to it , so I gave it the ability to rotate the entire big wheel around a center point. From there I really just wanted to explore how these hypnotic circles can interact with each other.In the end it morphed into a record spinning. I tried to add music to it but that is just a little too advanced for me at the moment.

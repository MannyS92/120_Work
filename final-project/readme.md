# Final Project

## Project History

The first two weeks of this project were spent trying to get the snake game working.  I got the idea of making a snake game from Daniel Shiffman because he made a similar snake game and Ive always loved the game so I built off that game to create mine. I also followed along in the lessons provided in the module and a background image of some grass. The last thing I did was add a score counter to it. 


## Successes
I was able to create the game of Snake, it was hard getting the array working properly so that the tail would keep getting longer every time the snake eats the fruit but with some research I was able to figure out how to do it. I also created a score counter so that the player can have some additional incentive be along snake. I also was able to get an image uploaded and set as the background.

## Failures

I tried to get sound to play, but for some reason the console just kept telling me that my var sound was undefined.

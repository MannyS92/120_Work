## HW-6

I thought I was gonna hate this week. Esecially when I started the lessons and I had such a hard time understanding everything. But I must say I really loved using algorithims to create this homework. I started off just exploring trying to learn how my decisions in the algorithims effected the sketch.

I did that for a very long time before I even started looking at exactly what the howework was. I then started slowly adding all the requirments and I just let it take me wherever.

I played with my "trees" algorithims for a while and then I noticed they look like trees, but Im having trouble understanding why they look like the way they do. I kind of understand whats going on, I just feel like I need an outside explanation.

Other than that I didnt run into any problems this week. There were a couple times I had to problem solve to  see why my code wasnt working, but I was able to figure those out on my own.

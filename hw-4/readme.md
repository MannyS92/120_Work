After going through all the lessons, I experimented for a little bit to try and put some of what I learned to memory. I then sketched a few ideas for my monster and I wanted to go for a mix between Hal 9000 and the monsters from "War of the Worlds."

I then went through a painful proccess of trial and error to try and create it. I had to return to the lessons multiple times to really get what I was trying to do.

I ran into a few problems where my sketch wouldnt render in my browser, I solved these problems by using the developer tool in safari and it showed me what line my syntax error was on.

I didnt need to post anything to the issues forum this week, and I didnt feel I knew anybodys questions this week.

I dont feel  like I fully understood how radians work and Im having trouble remember the meaning for all the variables in the different shapes, I feel that Im forgetting what they mean but I will just have to keep practicing to commit them to memory.

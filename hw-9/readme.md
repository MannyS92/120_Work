# Week 12
When I went through this lesson I honestly didnt think I would ever understand exactly whats going on because each week is going fast but after spending a long time working on this , I really feel like Im get it. I only came across a few problems that I now cant solve. How to make my victory text stay longer. Also how I could flesh this game out more and make it so after you hit the target it creates a new smaller target, or maybe a moving target.

Also my bullet is bouncing off to soon and I know it must be a math issue but I cant figure it out.

OVerall this week was exhausting and fun.

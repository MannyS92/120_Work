# Final Project

For my final project I want to make a story based version of the classic game snake.

I want to start with snake and add better looking sprites in place of the standard rectangles and then I want the playing of the game to unfold a mini story. As you begin small and get bigger and bigger , it will tell the story of the snakes quest to fill the gaping hole in his soul until he eventually eats himself. The game will then restart.

I already have the frameworks of the snake game complete. So for all next week my goal is to improve graphics, and add music. In the final week I will add the text that will tell the story.
